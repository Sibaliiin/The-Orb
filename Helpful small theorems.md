This is a collection of theorems where the proofs are either _trivial_, or take little time to prove.

# even $\cdot$ even $=$ even
$$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, 2\mid a, 2\mid b \to 2\mid ab.$$
If $2\mid a \to a=2m, m \in \mathbb{Z}.$
If $2\mid b \to b=2n, n \in \mathbb{Z}.$
$a\cdot b = 2m\cdot2n = 4mn, 2\mid 4mn.\square$
# uneven $\cdot$ uneven $=$ uneven
$$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, 2\nmid a, 2\nmid b \to 2\nmid ab.$$
If $2\nmid a \to a=2m+1$
If $2\nmid b \to a=2n+1$
$a\cdot b = (2m+1)(2n+1) = 4mn + 2m +2n + 1$, and this is not divisible by $2$ (we have $+1$ as a remainder). $\square$
# If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ is even.
$$a \in \mathbb{Z}, 2\mid a^2 \to 2\mid a$$
When we square a number, let us say, $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, we essentially multiply the number by itself: $a\cdot a$.
This can go two ways: 
$$
\text{(1) even} \cdot \text{even} = \text{even},
$$
$$
\text{(2) uneven}\cdot \text{uneven} = \text{uneven}.
$$
Proofs: [[Helpful small theorems#even $ cdot$ even $=$ even|(1)]], [[Helpful small theorems#uneven $ cdot$ uneven $=$ uneven|(2)]].

This means that if we have an even square, then the square root of it must be even as well. $\square$.
