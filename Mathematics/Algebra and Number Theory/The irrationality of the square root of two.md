## Theorem 
The square root of two is [[Q* - Irrational numbers|irrational]] ($\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}^*$) 

## Proof
We will use [[Proof by contradiction|proof by contradiction]]. Let us say that $\sqrt{2}$ is [[Q - Rational numbers|rational]], meaning:
$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q},\textrm{ where: } p,q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \ne 0, (p,q)=1.
$$
Square both sides. This gives us
$$
2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \to 2q^2 = p^2,
$$
meaning that $p^2$ is an _even_ number (it is divisible by 2). If that is the case, then $p$ is _also_ even. Meaning that  $p$ is a product of $2$ and another integer: $p = 2\cdot m$. We can substitute $2m$ back into the original equality:
$$
2q^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2
$$
$$
q^2 = 2m^2
$$
, which means $q^2$ is an even number. That makes $q$ an even number also. Meaning that $q$ is divisible by $2$.
But, $p$ is _also_ divisible by $2$. This means that $p$ and $q$ have a common divisor: 
$$
(p,q)=2
$$
But the starting requirements clearly stated that the largest common divisor of $p$ and $q$ was $1$. Here:
$$
(p,q)\ne 1.
$$
And this is where the contradiction lies. Which means:
_The square root of two $(\sqrt{2})$ is irrational._
