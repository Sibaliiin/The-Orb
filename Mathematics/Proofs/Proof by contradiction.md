This is a method of proving a logical statement by taking the statement's negation, and trying to prove it if it was true. If we run into a contradiction (like $1=2$), then we know that the negation was false, meaning that the original statement is true.

# Some examples
$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational $\to$ $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.
