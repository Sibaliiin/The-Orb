We define divisibility on the whole numbers.
Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. $a$ is divisible by $b$ if there exists an $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ where
$$
a = b\cdot m.
$$
We write _divisibility_ like this:
$$
b \mid a.
$$
For example: $6$ is divisible by $2$: $2\mid 6 \to 6=2\cdot3$
But $7$ is not divisible by $2$, for example ($2\nmid 7$).
