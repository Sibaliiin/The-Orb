Prime numbers play an important role in all of mathematics. Our everyday life is governed by them in ways we do not even notice.
In everyday language, we say that a number is *prime* if it is only [[Divisibility|divisible]] by $1$, and itself; meaning we cannot cut it up into more numbers.
For example, $7$ is prime, because it is only divisible by _itself_ and $1$. But, $6$ is not prime, because $2\mid 6 \to 6 = 2\cdot 3$.
