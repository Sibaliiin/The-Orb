Prime numbers play an important role in all of mathematics. Our everyday life is governed by them in ways we do not even notice.
In everyday language, we say that a number is *prime* if it is only [[Divisibility|divisible]] by $1$, and itself; meaning we cannot cut it up into more numbers.
For example, $7$ is prime, because it is only divisible by _itself_ and $1$. But, $6$ is not prime, because $2\mid 6 \to 6 = 2\cdot 3$.
We can prove that there are an infinite number of primes out there; but we do not know their distribution.

# Proper definition
When we talk about _prime numbers_, we usually mean the primes which are in the [[Z - Whole numbers|set of whole numbers]]. There are other kinds of primes; for example, the _Gauss-primes_.
From now on, when we talk about _prime numbers_, we will think of the ones in _the set of whole numbers_.

## Irreducibility and Primality
There are two properties of whole numbers that we need to discuss. They are: _irreducibility_ and _primality_.

A whole number, $f$,  is _irreducible_ when:
$f, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}:$
$$
f = a\cdot b \implies a = 1 \text{ or } b = 1.
$$
A whole number, $p$, is _prime_ when:
$p, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}:$
$$
p \mid ab \implies p \mid a \text{ or } p\mid b.
$$
