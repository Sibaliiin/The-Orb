# How to use
You need to clone this git repository and open the cloned directory as your vault in Obsidian.
Make a new directory and open it:
``` bash
mkdir "YourDirectory"
cd "YourDirectory"
```
After that, clone the git repository into this directory:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Sibaliiin/The-Orb.git
```
After this step, you have the repository "downloaded" successfully!
Now, open Obsidian and open "The-Orb" as the vault.
Happy reading!
